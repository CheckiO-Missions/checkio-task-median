    A median is a numerical value separating the upper half of a list of numbers from the lower half.
    In a list where there are an odd number of entities, the median is the number found in the middle of the list.
    If the list contains and even number of entities, then there is no single middle value, instead the median becomes the average of the two numbers found in the middle. 
    For this mission, you are given a list of integers. With it, you must separate the upper half of
    the numbers from the lower half and find the median.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
<pre class="brush: python">checkio([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 3
checkio([3, 1, 2, 5, 3]) == 3
checkio([1, 300, 2, 200, 1]) == 2
checkio([3, 6, 20, 99, 10, 15]) == 12.5</pre>

    <strong>How the median is used:</strong> The median has usage for Statistics and Probability theory.
    It has a very significant value for skewed distribution. For example, we want to know average wealth of people from a set of
    data -- 100 people earn $100 in month and 10 people earn $1,000,000. If we find the average, then we get $91,000.
    This is weird value and does nothing to show us the real picture. In this case the median would give to us more useful value and a better picture.
