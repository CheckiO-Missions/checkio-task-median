    A median is a number in a list that is in between the highest numbers and the lowest numbers.
    If there is an even number of numbers, then there is no single middle value:
    the median is then defined as the mean or average of the two middle values.
    For this mission, you are given a list of integers. With it, you must separate the upper half of
    the numbers, from the lower half and find the median.

    <strong>Input: </strong> A list of integers.

    <strong>Output: </strong> A float.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
<pre class="brush: python">checkio([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 3
checkio([3, 1, 2, 5, 3]) == 3
checkio([1, 300, 2, 200, 1]) == 2
checkio([3, 6, 20, 99, 10, 15]) == 12.5</pre>

    <strong>How it is used:</strong> The median has usage for Statistics and Probability theory.
    It very significant value for skewed distribution. For example, we want to know average wealth of people and gained
    some data -- 100 people have 100$ in month and 10 people have 1000000$. If we use average, then we have 91000$ at man.
    This is weird value and don't show to us the real picture. So for this case the median will give to us more useful value.
